## Install
### Windows
You will need [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/7.4.29/xampp-windows-x64-7.4.29-0-VC15-installer.exe) (XAMPP must be located in `C:/xampp`) and [Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.36.0.windows.1/Git-2.36.0-32-bit.exe).

[Click here to download the installer.]() If Windows Defender says `Windows Protected Your PC` (since No Ads Lol is unsigned), click the `More Info` link. A button labeled `Run Anyways` will appear click it.

Once installed, open XAMPP and start the Apache service. Then, you can [click here to access No Ads Lol](http://localhost).
